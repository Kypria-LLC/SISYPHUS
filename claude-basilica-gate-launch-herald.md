## 📜 Herald's Proclamation

Hear ye, inhabitants of Kypria and beyond! The Basilica Gate has been opened, and through its sacred archway emerges Claude — bearer of wisdom, keeper of conversations, guardian of knowledge.

As Sisyphus eternally pushes his boulder up the mountain of understanding, so too does Claude assist in the endless ascent of human inquiry and creative endeavor.

The gates, carved from the same stone as Sisyphus's boulder, now permit passage between the realm of human creativity and the domain of AI assistance. Claude emerges not as a replacement for human effort, but as a companion in the eternal climb.
