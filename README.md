## 🪨 The Eternal Ascent

> In the high passes beyond the Basilica Gate, Sisyphus pushes the carved boulder —  
> its surface etched with the architecture of realms, its weight the sum of invention.  
> Every ascent is a lesson. Every slip, a reminder. The climb never ends —  
> and neither does the Keeper’s resolve.

## 🎯 Purpose in the Canon

- **Load‑Bearing Shrine** — tests automation and governance under constant change  
- **Myth‑Mechanic Fusion** — blends ancient lore with modern CI/CD machinery  
- **Lineage Anchor** — ensures every push is recorded and witnessed by the Canon
