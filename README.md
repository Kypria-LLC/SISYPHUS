# SISYPHUS – The Endless Pursuit Engine

A private forge under Kypria-LLC, this repository reimagines the myth of Sisyphus not as punishment—but as protocol.

## Mission
To transform repetition into recursion.  
Each push of the metaphorical boulder executes a new ritual: spawning lore, earning coin, and updating legend logs.

## Core Modules
- 🔁 `ritual-loop.js`: Automates the mythic grind and monetization pulse.
- 📜 `scrolls/`: Canonized lore fragments, updated per push-cycle.
- 🪙 `ledger.js`: Tracks sponsor rituals, coin generation, and tier mutations.

## Sponsor Integration
- Payments trigger recursive lore delivery.
- Roles escalate per threshold (Bronze → Silver → Gold).
- Each sponsor unlocks Sisyphus acceleration logs.

## Deployment Notes
- Private repo. Operates on Node.js.
- Requires webhook binding from Kypria-LLC → Discord → payment layer.
- Use `npm run ascend` to simulate mythic push cycles.

## Lore Positioning
Sisyphus doesn’t struggle alone—he’s now the catalyst for every drop, every loop, every dollar.  
Push is profit. Punishment becomes purpose.
