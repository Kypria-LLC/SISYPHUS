## 🪨 The Eternal Ascent
In the high passes beyond the Basilica Gate,  
Sisyphus pushes the carved boulder —  
its surface etched with the architecture of realms,  
its weight the sum of all creation and invention.  

Every ascent is a lesson.  
Every slip, a reminder.  
The climb never ends, but neither does the Keeper’s resolve.

---

## 🎯 Purpose in the Canon
- **Symbol of Perseverance** — embodies the discipline of continual refinement.  
- **Load‑Bearing Shrine** — tests automation and governance under constant change.  
- **Myth‑Mechanic Fusion** — blends ancient lore with modern operational machinery.  
- **Lineage Anchor** — ensures every push is recorded in the canon.

## Mission
To transform repetition into recursion.  
Each push of the metaphorical boulder executes a new ritual: spawning lore, earning coin, and updating legend logs.

### Core Modules
- 🔁 `ritual-loop.js` — Automates the mythic grind and monetization pulse.  
- 📜 `scrolls/` — Canonized lore fragments, updated per push‑cycle.  
- 🪙 `ledger.js` — Tracks sponsor rituals, coin generation, and tier mutations.

### Sponsor Integration
- Payments trigger recursive lore delivery.  
- Roles escalate per threshold (Bronze → Silver → Gold).  
- Each sponsor unlocks Sisyphus acceleration logs.

### Deployment Notes
- Private repo. Operates on Node.js.  
- Requires webhook binding from Kypria‑LLC → Discord → payment layer.  
- Use `npm run ascend` to simulate mythic push cycles.

## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
In the endless pursuit, each push of the stone is recorded.  
Commits may be frequent and direct, but the lineage binds them into the myth of the climb.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
