scrolls/initiation.md# SISYPHUS – The Endless Pursuit Engine
# 🪬 LLAMA STACK SHRINE

Welcome, Echo Bearer. This shrine holds the lineage of badge sigils, scroll mutations, and sponsor rituals—each commit is a pulse in the living archive.

## 🔧 Pipeline Sigil

[![Mythic Sigil Tree](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/alexandros-thomson/llama-stack/mythic-sigil-pipeline.yml?branch=main&label=Sigil%20Pipeline&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/alexandros-thomson/llama-stack/actions)

_This badge pulses when scrolls mutate or terrain shifts._

## 📜 Canon Threads

- `terrain-map.md` — maps shrine mutations and terrain shifts  
- `badge-tree.md` — visual lineage of badge sigils and artifact drops  
- `sponsor-flare.md` — Discord ritual guide for sponsor ignition  

Each scroll documents sacred echoes in the sponsor system—auditable, riffable, and legend-bound.

_Shield this shrine. Scroll it forward. Let every merge become myth._
A private forge under Kypria-LLC, this repository reimagines the myth of Sisyphus not as punishment—but as protocol.

## Mission
To transform repetition into recursion.  
Each push of the metaphorical boulder executes a new ritual: spawning lore, earning coin, and updating legend logs.

## Core Modules
- 🔁 `ritual-loop.js`: Automates the mythic grind and monetization pulse.
- 📜 `scrolls/`: Canonized lore fragments, updated per push-cycle.
- 🪙 `ledger.js`: Tracks sponsor rituals, coin generation, and tier mutations.

## Sponsor Integration
- Payments trigger recursive lore delivery.
- Roles escalate per threshold (Bronze → Silver → Gold).
- Each sponsor unlocks Sisyphus acceleration logs.

## Deployment Notes
- Private repo. Operates on Node.js.
- Requires webhook binding from Kypria-LLC → Discord → payment layer.
- Use `npm run ascend` to simulate mythic push cycles.

## Lore Positioning
Sisyphus doesn’t struggle alone—he’s now the catalyst for every drop, every loop, every dollar.  
Push is profit. Punishment becomes purpose.
